### Selecting Data from a Database

```
SELECT statement - results in a result set. Lists rows that contain same # of rows. Returns a list of data.    
I.e SELECT column_2, column_3 FROM table_name
Optional clauses: WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING (use with GROUP BY), ORDER BY
(3) SELECT custname, city, state
(1) FROM Customers
(2) WHERE state=’NY’
1, 2, 3 included to visualize the order in which the query finds the data
(3) - SELECT returns the data
```


At least 1 space between words. Multiple spaces/line breaks ok.
table/column/index names must: 
begin with a letter, limit 30 chars, no spaces
Case sensitive
Close string literals in single quotes ‘ ‘

Comments:  
-- insert comment here (single or in line comment)
/*multi-line
  comment*/

### Performing a conditional search

Single search conditions
I.e: SELECT ordernum, state, qty, repid
      FROM sales
      WHERE repid = ‘NO2’

Multiple search conditions: use keyword AND.
I.e: SELECT ordnum, sldate, qty, partnum, repid
      FROM sales
      WHERE repid = ‘NO2’ AND qty >= 400
Arithmetic operators can be used after field name in SELECT search:
I.e: SELECT bktitle, pubdate, slprice + 20
      FROM titles
      WHERE slprice + 20 > 50

Column Aliasing:
SELECT bktitle, slprice + slprice * .05 AS newslprice ←Alias
Alias displayed as a new column in query result
AS is not required.
I.e: SELECT bktitle, slprice + slprice * .05 newslprice (AS omitted)
Or  SELECT bktitle, slprice + slprice * .05 AS ‘New Sale Price’
Or  SELECT bktitle, newslprice = slprice + slprice * .05

Logical Operators: ALL, AND, ANY, BETWEEN, EXISTS, IN, LIKE, OR, SOME, NOT
Be mindful of Order of Operations
Parenthesis: AND performed before OR, unless overridden by parenthesis
Between...AND operator:
I.e: SELECT bktitle, slprice
       FROM Titles
       WHERE slprice NOT BETWEEN 50 AND 55

IN operator: SELECT custname
            FROM customers
                    WHERE state IN (‘CA’, ‘NY’, ‘MA’)
NULL = unknown. Not zero, not blank spaces. IS NULL; IS NOT NULL
Wildcards: % and _ (underscore).
% used to allow one or more chars to be substituted in a field
_ allows a single char in a syntax expression to be substituted
Used with WHERE and LIKE operators, and can be used in combination
I.e ‘_a%’ - one leading character, and ‘a’ and any number of chars following
upperof/lowerof used in either SELECT or WHERE.
In SELECT: return result in upper or lower case
In WHERE: search for upper or lower case data 

Regular Expressions: WHERE custnum REGEXP ‘^...[19]$;
^ beginning anchor, . single char wildcard, $ ending anchor

### Working with Functions

Types of functions: configuration, cursor, date & time, metadata, string, etc
I.e: SELECT bktitle
    , DATE_ADD(pubdate, INTERVAL 3 MONTH) AS new_pubdate
    , TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, pubdate, ‘2017-12-31’) AS diff_date
DATE_ADD function requires 2 parameters: field name and how much time to add
TIMESTAMPDIFF function requires 3 parameters: Part of date to compare, name of field, and date string literal
Nested functions
SELECT partnum, bktitle, pubdate, TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, pubdate, NOW())
      FROM titles
Passes NOW() function which calls for current date/time, as a parameter into TIMESTAMPDIFF() function

Aggregate Functions: SELECT COUNT(qty) total_qty, AVG(qty) avg_qty
            FROM sales
Will return the ‘qty’ field passed into the COUNT() and AVG() functions from the sales table, in new total_qty and avg_qty fields
COUNT(), AVG(), SUM(), MIN()

DISTINCT keyword returns no duplicate rows in output
I.e: SELECT DISTINCT city, state
      FROM customers
DISTINCT in a COUNT() function:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS #_Rows
, COUNT(city) AS #_Cities
, COUNT(DISTICT city) AS #_Unique_Cities
FROM Customers
Returns number of entries in all fields in new #_Rows field
Returns number of entries in ‘city’ field in new #_Cities field
Returns number of unique entries in ‘city’ field in new #_Unique_Cities field

Strings in single quotes, case matched, and cannot be used in arithmetic calcs
String Functions: LEN()
I.e: SELECT custname, custnum, LEN(custname) length
      FROM customers
Returns entries including the fields custname and custnum. Also returns the # of characters in ‘custname’ field in new field called ‘length’
Case conversions: UPPER() and LOWER()
Leading/trailing spaces take up allocated VARCHAR() character lengths
Trim functions LTRIM() and RTRIM() remove left and right blank spaces in a string
SUBSTRING() function: requires 3 parameters
SELECT custnum, SUBSTRING(custname, 5, 10) custname,
SUBSTRING(‘NEW YORK’, 5, 4) statename
FROM customers
Returns the ‘custnum’ field as first field
Returns the data in ‘custnum’ field starting with the 5th character, and extract 10 characters in a field called ‘custnum’
Returns from the string literal in the first parameter, 4 characters starting with the 5th character in the string.
Concatenation. Fields must be of the same data type. Concatenation still includes trailing spaces.
Can remove trailing spaces with TRIM() function inside CONCAT() function.
I.e: SELECT redip, CONCAT(TRIM(lname), ‘, ‘, TRIM(fname)) AS Name
      FROM slspers
Will combine lname and fname fields into new field titled ‘Name’
Removes trailing spaces, strings separated by a comma
