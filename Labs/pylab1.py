# Python Fundamentals
Understanding the Python programming language

## Introduction to Python ([from Real Python](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python3-introduction/))
"Python is a beautiful language. It’s easy to learn and fun, and its syntax is simple yet elegant. Python is a popular choice for beginners, yet still powerful enough to back some of the world’s most popular products and applications from companies like NASA, Google, Mozilla, Cisco, Microsoft, and Instagram, among others. Whatever the goal, Python’s design makes the programming experience feel almost as natural as writing in English.

### Primitives and Data Types
#### Numbers, Strings, and Booleans

##### Numbers
```
#Python has integers and floats.
#Integers are simply whole numbers, like 314, 500, and 716.
#Floats are fractional numbers like 3.14, 2.867, 76.88887.

>>> type(3) <class 'int'>
>>> type(3.14) <class 'float'>
>>> pi = 3.14
>>> type(pi) <class 'float'>
#You can use the type method to check the value of an object.

>>> type(3)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(3.14)
<class 'float'>
>>> pi = 3.14
>>> type(pi)
<class 'float'>






#You can use the basic mathematical operators:

>>>3+3
6
>>>3-3
0
>>>3/3
1.0
>>>3/2
```

##### Strings
```
#A string of characters - anything you can type on the keyboard in one keystroke
#Python recognizes '' and "" as the beginning and end of strings

>>> a = "first"
>>> b = "last"
>>>a+b
'firstlast'

#String methods for you to choose from - like upper(), lower(), replace(), and count()
#
>>>str = 'woah!'
>>>str.upper()
'WOAH!'

>>>str.lower()
'woah!'

>>>str.replace('a', 'r')
>>>str.replace('h', 'd')
'word'

>>>str.count('w')
1

#You can format/create strings with the format() method.
>>>"{0} is a lot of {1}".format("Python", "fun!")
'Python is a lot of fun!'
```


##### Booleans
```
#Boolean values are simply True or False
#We check to see if a value is equal to another value with two equal signs.

>>>10==10
True
>>>10==11
False
>>> "jack" == "jack"
True
>>> "jack" == "jake"
False

#To check for inequality use !=
>>>10!=10
False
>>>10!=11
True
>>> "jack" != "jack"
False
>>> "jack" != "jake"
True

#You can also test for>,<,>=, and<=
>>>10>10
False
>>>10<11
True
>>>10>=10
True
>>>10<=11
True
>>>10<=10<0
False
>>>10<=10<11
True
>>> "jack" > "jack"
False

```


## Collections
#### Lists
```
#Lists are containers for holding values as variables
>>> number_list =['one', 'two', '3' 'one', 'two', 'two']

#To access the elements in the list you can use their index value.
#Just remember that all lists starts at index 0, not 1

>>> number_list[2]
'two'

#You can count from the end as well
>>> number_list[-3]
'one'

#Lists also contain methods
#Use len to check the size of the list
>>> number_list.len()
6

#Check to see if a value exists
>>> 'two' in number_list
True
```
#### Dictionaries
```
#Dictionaries use key/value pairs for element lookup
>>> words = {'apple': 'red','lemon': 'yellow'}
>>> words
{'apple': 'red', 'lemon': 'yellow'}
>>> words['apple']
'red'
>>> words['lemon']
'yellow'

#Output all the keys with keys() and all the values with values()
>>> words.keys()
dict_keys(['apple', 'lemon'])
>>> words.values()
dict_values(['red', 'yellow'])
```
### Control Statements
#### If/Else Statements
```
>>>num=20
>>> if num == 20:
        print('the number is 20')
    elif num > 20:
        print('the number is greater than 20')
    else:
      print('the number is not 20')


the number is 20

```
#### Loops
```
#Python uses for-loops and while-loops

>>> colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
>>> colors
['red', 'green', 'blue']
>>> for color in colors:
       print('I love ' + color)

I love red I love green I love blue

>>>num=1
>>> num
1
>>> while num <= 5: print(num)
        print(num)
        num+=1

1
2
3
4
5
```
### Functions
```
#Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a single task.

>>> def multiply(num1, num2=10):    
        return num1 * num2

>>> multiply(2)
20

```

### Exercises

### Team and Individual Challenge with Python Functions

##### Part_1
```
HOW-TO: Create a multi-line string variable called my_story which contains a short story about an <animal> in a specific <borough> of New York, performing some <action> involving one specific type of <food>.

TODO: Ask the user to display in the command line, their selection for <animal>, <borough>, <action> and <food>

TODO: Create a Python program that swaps those items in your story

TODO: Print the user's story to the command line
```

##### Part_2
```
TODO: Make a function that asks user for their username, password, department

TODO: Make a function that takes a string and then hashes it.

TODO: Create a function that can use a while loop in a real world scenario.

TODO: Create a function that can calculate the average numbers in a given list.

TODO: Create a function that can reverse a given number.
```

###### Bonus: Make a program that combines some of these functions.
